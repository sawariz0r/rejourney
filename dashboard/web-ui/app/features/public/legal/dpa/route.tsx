                                This Data Processing Agreement ("DPA") is between Rejourney ("Processor") and the Customer ("Controller"). It outlines the parties' obligations regarding the processing of Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Processor will process Personal Data only as necessary to provide the Service as described in the Terms, to create anonymized or aggregated outputs as authorized below, and as further specified in <strong>Annex I</strong>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Controller instructs and authorizes Processor to analyze Customer Data and service telemetry to create anonymized, aggregated, or de-identified datasets for product analytics, service improvement, benchmarking, research, and publication of general trend reports, articles, benchmarks, and similar public findings. Processor will not publish raw session recordings, screenshots, request payloads, Personal Data, Controller confidential information, or statistics that reasonably identify or single out Controller, a specific application, or any data subject without Controller's separate permission.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mt-2">
                                Pseudonymized data remains Personal Data where it can be attributed to an individual using additional information. Anonymous information created under this section is not subject to this DPA only where the relevant individuals are not or are no longer identifiable by means reasonably likely to be used.
                            </p>

                            </p>
