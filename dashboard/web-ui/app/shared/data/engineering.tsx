        <p>
            Today we are opening the beta for the native <strong>Rejourney Swift Package</strong>.
            This is not a greenfield recorder and it is not a thin wrapper around our React Native
            module. It is a SwiftPM-native iOS SDK built from the same production recorder that has
            been exercised inside our heavily used React Native package: the same replay lifecycle,
            the same ingest protocol, the same on-device privacy posture, and the same bias toward
            refusing work when the host app needs the frame budget more than we do.
        </p>
        <p>
            The short version: React Native gave us distribution pressure and failure data; SwiftPM
            gave us a cleaner boundary. The beta exists because the native core has crossed the point
            where Swift-first apps should not need a JavaScript bridge, a CocoaPods podspec, or a React
            Native install just to get pixel replay, network telemetry, ANR detection, and session
            lifecycle semantics.

            <p>
                Our React Native package is where the recorder became boring in the best sense. It
                forced the native iOS and Android engines to survive real app startup races, navigation
                churn, background/foreground rollover, custom URLSession stacks, offline uploads, and
                aggressively animated screens. The Swift Package keeps that native core model.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                The reusable unit was never the JavaScript API. The reusable unit was the native capture
                pipeline: <strong>DeviceRegistrar</strong> establishes identity and upload credentials,
                <strong>ReplayOrchestrator</strong> owns the session state machine, <strong>VisualCapture</strong>
                and <strong>ViewHierarchyScanner</strong> produce time-aligned artifacts, and
                <strong>SegmentDispatcher</strong> ships compressed payloads into the same production ingest
                routes used by React Native.

                    The API Is Smaller Because the Runtime Is Smaller
                </h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                React Native needs to coordinate with a JS runtime that may not be ready when the native
                app delegate starts. It also needs optional navigation peers, bridge availability checks,
                and defensive no-op behavior when the host app has a partial install. Native Swift apps
                have a much cleaner contract: configure once, then start and stop from the app lifecycle
                you already own.
            </p>

            <p>
                Internally, the public enum is <code>@MainActor</code>. That is intentional. The caller-facing
                boundary is serialized through UIKit-safe execution, while encode, compression, retry, and
                telemetry work immediately leave the main actor through queues owned by the recorder. The
                package therefore has a Swift-native API without pretending UIKit capture can be made
                actor-agnostic.

                    Where the Architectures Diverge
                </h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                The React Native SDK is a cross-runtime integration layer. The Swift Package is a native
                library. That difference sounds obvious until you trace where state is allowed to live.
                In React Native, some state is naturally expressed in TypeScript: session options,
                navigation screen names, optional auto-tracking setup, and bridge resolution. In the Swift
                Package, those decisions move into native memory and native lifecycle code.

                That last point matters operationally. SwiftPM resolves a tagged repository product, not an
                npm tarball that later delegates to CocoaPods. The package target points at
                <code>packages/ios/Sources/Rejourney</code>, processes <code>PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy</code>,
                and links <code>z</code> for compression. The beta is therefore versioned and validated as
                an iOS library, not as a subdirectory side effect of the React Native release.

                We did not relax the recorder just because the package is easier to install. The pipeline
                still has to balance four clocks: UIKit's main-thread rendering clock, our screenshot cadence,
                hierarchy/event timelines, and the backend ingest lifecycle. If any one clock becomes the
                source of truth for too long, replay quality drops or app performance suffers.

                Network tracking also moves closer to iOS primitives. The Swift Package uses
                <code>URLProtocol</code> registration plus configuration swizzling to observe sessions
                created by common networking stacks, while the dispatcher's own ephemeral session strips
                that protocol back out. That prevents the SDK from intercepting its own uploads, which is
                the kind of bug that looks harmless in development and very expensive under real traffic.

            <p>
                The core recorder is not beta-quality. The distribution surface is what we want more signal
                on: SwiftPM resolution across real Xcode projects, app-extension edge cases, privacy manifest
                behavior, enterprise CI cache behavior, and how teams want to model explicit screen tracking
                in SwiftUI, UIKit, and mixed apps.

                Versioning is intentionally independent from the React Native package. Native iOS releases use
                plain semver tags such as <code>v0.2.0</code>, while React Native can keep its own package and
                tag cadence. A CI check keeps <code>packages/ios/VERSION</code> and
                <code>RejourneySDKInfo.version</code> aligned before a tag is created.

                The Swift Package lets us treat native iOS as a first-class integration target instead of a
                platform implementation detail behind React Native. The important part is that we got there
                without forking the product model: sessions, artifacts, replay timelines, upload credentials,
                sampling, observe-only mode, and backend finalization still speak the same protocol.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                That is the architectural line we want to keep: different host runtimes, shared replay
                semantics. React Native will continue to drive cross-platform ergonomics. SwiftPM will let us
                go deeper on iOS-specific correctness, performance, and privacy. The beta is the point where
                those two tracks stop blocking each other.

            Quick growth for any startup is hard. However, the difficulty is far greater when your startup handles hundreds to thousands of small files ingested every minute. Every startup dreams of that "hockey stick" moment, but as we recently learned at Rejourney, the infrastructure that supports 10,000 sessions a day doesn't always handle 100,000 with the same grace.

            Last month, we officially onboarded new customers with expansive user bases across several high-traffic mobile apps. It was a milestone for our team, but it also quickly became an "all-hands-on-deck" engineering challenge.

                The trouble started almost immediately after they loaded Rejourney live on their apps. Within minutes, our ingestion metrics spiked by an order of magnitude.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                At the edge, Cloudflare’s automated security systems saw this sudden, massive influx of traffic to our API and did exactly what they were programmed to do: they flagged it as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Legitimate session data from thousands of users was being dropped before it even reached our infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                Our immediate fix was to implement a bypass filter for our specific API endpoint. We wanted to ensure no data was lost and that the onboarding experience was seamless. We flipped the switch, the "Attack Mode" subsided, and the floodgates opened.

            <p>
                Opening the floodgates is only a good idea if your reservoir can handle the volume. By bypassing the edge protection, we redirected the full, unthrottled weight of the traffic directly to our origin server.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                At the time, our backend was running on a single-node K3s cluster. While we’ve optimized our ingestion pipeline to be lean, no single node is immune to a "thundering herd." As thousands of concurrent connections hit our API, our Ingest Pods were pinned at Max CPU, and the server eventually became unresponsive.

            <p>
                The biggest bottleneck in our old setup was the "monolithic" nature of ingestion. If a pod restarted, in-memory tasks were lost. We’ve now decomposed the pipeline into five specialized, durable stages:
            </p>

            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 mt-4 ml-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>The Control Plane (API):</strong> Our API pods now focus exclusively on the "handshake." When the SDK calls our endpoints, we immediately create durable rows in Postgres (via PgBouncer) to track the session and ingest jobs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Upload Relay:</strong> We isolated heavy client upload traffic into its own <code>ingest-upload</code> layer. These pods act as a relay to Hetzner S3, ensuring that a flood of incoming bytes doesn't starve our core API of resources.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Durable Queue Boundary:</strong> We moved away from in-memory task management. Work is now represented as durable rows in Postgres. If a worker pod crashes or restarts, the job still exists in the database, waiting to be claimed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Specialized Worker Deployments:</strong> We split our processing power. <code>ingest-workers</code> handle lightweight metadata like events and crashes, while <code>replay-workers</code> tackle the heavy lifting of screenshots and hierarchies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Self-Healing Reconciliation:</strong> A dedicated <code>session-lifecycle-worker</code> performs periodic sweeps to recover stuck states or abandon expired artifacts.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mt-4">
                By using Postgres as the source of truth for state and S3 for storage, our system is now remarkably resilient. Even if Redis or individual pods face transient issues, the state survives and processing resumes exactly where it left off.
            </p>

                We’ve moved away from the single-node bottleneck to a High Availability configuration. We now run HA Postgres and Redis with automated failover. If a VPS goes down, the databases automatically fall back to a replica. The platform keeps moving, and the data stays safe.

            <p>
                As we scaled, we hit a literal physical limit: providers like Hetzner often impose a 50-million-object limit per bucket. To bypass this, we implemented a dynamic <strong>multi-bucket topology</strong>.

                Instead of hard-coding storage locations in environment variables, we moved the source of truth to a <code>storage_endpoints</code> table in Postgres. This allows us to manage storage with extreme granularity:

        <p>
            Capturing high-fidelity session replays of native map views (Apple Maps, Google Maps, Mapbox)
            on 120Hz "ProMotion" screens is notoriously difficult. The standard approach of repeatedly
            snapshotting the view hierarchy often leads to <strong>micro-stutters</strong> and <strong>tearing</strong>
            because the capture loop fights with the map's own aggressive rendering loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            We discovered that simply scheduling captures on a timer wasn't enough.
            To achieve buttery-smooth 120Hz performance while recording, we had to get deeper:
            <strong> Hooking the native map SDK rendering delegates. In simiple terms, Rejourney only captures screenshots on maps when it is idle and not being panned or zoomed.</strong>
        </p>

                    THE CHALLENGE

                    The 120Hz Conflict
                </h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Modern map SDKs drive the GPU hard. On an iPhone 15 Pro, a map sitting idle might be efficient,
                but the moment a user pans or zooms, the map engine locks the main thread's render server to
                maintain 120 FPS.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                If a session replay SDK tries to force a `drawHierarchy` or `snapshotView` call in the middle
                of this gesture, two things happen:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4 ml-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Dropped Frames (Stutter):</strong> The map renderer blocks waiting for the snapshot
                    to complete, causing a visible hitch in the user's scroll.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Visual Artifacts:</strong> The snapshot might capture a half-rendered buffer state.
                </li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <p>
                Instead of guessing when to capture, we ask the Map SDK itself. We reverse-engineered the
                delegate lifecycles of the major map providers to identify the exact moments when the map
                is <strong>Idle</strong> (safe to capture) vs. <strong>Moving</strong> (unsafe to capture).

                Most mobile session replay tools attempt to <strong>reconstruct</strong> the
                session rather than record it. Tools like <strong>PostHog</strong>, <strong>LogRocket</strong>,
                and <strong>Microsoft Clarity</strong> use native APIs to serialize the view
                hierarchy or capture low-level drawing commands.

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 my-6">
                <li>
                    <strong>PostHog & LogRocket:</strong> Primarily serialize the <strong>View Tree</strong>.
                    They inspect the UI structure and reconstruct it as wireframes or static UI state snapshots
                    synced with event streams. While efficient, they often miss the "visual truth" of high-motion
                    GPU content.

                    <strong>Microsoft Clarity:</strong> Captures low-level <strong>Drawing Commands</strong> to
                    provide a "walkthrough-style" video. It buffers visual commands on-device, but it
                    isn't capturing the final rendered outcome seen by the user.

            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Rejourney is different:</strong> We capture the actual <strong>GPU Framebuffer</strong>{" "}
                (via <code>drawHierarchy</code>). This ensures <strong>Pixel-Perfect Accuracy</strong>.
                If your app uses <strong>Metal</strong>, <strong>Maps</strong>, or custom shaders that
                native view serialization can't understand, Rejourney records them exactly as they
                appeared on the user's screen.

                While competitors rely on reconstructing a simulation from data points, Rejourney delivers a true visual record of the session. We handle the heavy lifting of <strong>GPU-ready capture</strong> while ensuring zero impact on the main thread.

                To achieve high-fidelity replay (3 FPS) without impacting frame rates,

            <p>
                Being lightweight isn't just about moving work to background threads. It's about <strong>strategic omission</strong> and defensive engineering. Our SDK includes several "invisible" optimizations to ensure we never impact your app's performance.

                    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                        Hierarchy scanning has a hard 16ms bailout. If your view tree is massive, we stop scanning before we block the next frame. We prioritize your app's FPS over our own data completeness.

                        Animated iOS views often produce "degenerate" frames (NaN/Infinity sizes). Our SDK sanitizes every coordinate before serialization to prevent JSON crashes, a common failure point in mobile replay tools.

                    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                        We only capture the Key Window. This automatically skips high-frequency system windows (like the Keyboard or Alert layers) that would otherwise cause redundant processing and rendering artifacts.

                        Instead of capturing at 3x Retina scale, we use a fixed 1.25x scale. This results in a ~6x reduction in JPEG size while maintaining perfect legibility for debugging sessions.

            <p>
                Our journey to high-fidelity replay wasn't symmetrical. On Android, <strong>Kotlin proved exceptionally performant</strong> from day one. Its modern concurrency primitives and efficient bytecode generation allowed us to hit our performance targets with minimal architectural thrashing.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                iOS was a different story. Our initial prototype was built in legacy <strong>Objective-C</strong>. While functional, the overhead of the dynamic runtime and the complexity of managing thread-safe manual memory buffers created persistent micro-stutter in high-traffic apps.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                We made the decision to rewrite the core capture engine in <strong>Swift</strong>. The result was an immediate and dramatic improvement in main-thread responsiveness. By leveraging Swift's stricter type system and more efficient handling of OperationQueues and GCD, we managed to cut per-frame overhead by over 40% compared to the original Obj-C implementation.
